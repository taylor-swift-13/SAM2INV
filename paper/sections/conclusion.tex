%% ============================================================

We have presented \textsc{SAM2INV}, an end-to-end system for automatic
loop invariant synthesis that tightly integrates large language models
with dynamic sampling and formal verification.
The three pillars of our approach---smart tiered sampling, parallel
diverse generation, and Houdini-style iterative pruning---address
complementary weaknesses of prior LLM-based methods:
sampling grounds the LLM in concrete program behaviour,
diversity increases the probability of generating the correct invariant,
and Houdini pruning provides monotonic progress guarantees within the
verification loop.

Our probabilistic loop synthesis DSL, \textsc{LoopFactory}, enables
controlled large-scale evaluation beyond the small existing benchmarks,
and its factorised generative distribution allows principled ablation
over program complexity dimensions.

%% TODO: Summarise experimental findings once available.

Several directions remain for future work.
First, extending the system to handle pointer-manipulating programs
and separation-logic invariants (via Coq/VST integration, which our
codebase already partially supports) would broaden the applicability
of the approach.
Second, replacing the prompt-based LLM interaction with fine-tuned
models trained on verified invariant datasets may improve both
accuracy and efficiency.
Third, integrating symbolic techniques---such as abstract
interpretation for computing initial bounds or interpolation for
strengthening failing invariants---could provide a hybrid
symbolic--neural architecture with stronger guarantees.
