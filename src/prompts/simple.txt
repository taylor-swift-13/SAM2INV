Follow the system prompt rules. This prompt adds only proof-oriented strategy.

Goal: produce a small, strong, inductive invariant set for the current loop.

Goal-specific guidance:
{{goal_guidance}}

Required construction order:
1. If a verification target is provided, map target terms to loop-preserved forms.
2. Add one core conservation/relational equality that explains loop updates (state transition law).
3. Add minimal progress bounds for loop counters and key arithmetic variables.
4. If a verification target is provided, ensure `invariants && !guard` can imply it.
5. Add complete and exact `loop assigns`.

Quality requirements:
- Prefer 3-6 strong invariants; avoid weak/tautological ones.
- Do not add unrelated invariants just to increase count.
- Reuse assert vocabulary/symbols directly whenever possible.
- Keep original code unchanged except loop annotations.

Code:
```c

Loop context:

Return only complete C code with ACSL loop annotations.
