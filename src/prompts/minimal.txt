Generate ACSL loop annotations (invariants, assigns, variant) for this code:

```c
{{content}}
```

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Loop invariants must hold at EVERY loop head (including loop exit). Do NOT use the loop guard as an invariant.
- \at(v, Pre) can ONLY be used on function parameters, NOT local variables.
- Do NOT use \forall, \exists, or custom predicates.
- Invariants must be strong enough to prove the assert after the loop.

Output ONLY the complete C code with loop invariants.
